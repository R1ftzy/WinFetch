# WinFetch
A lightweight neofetch-style system info tool for Windows, written in C.

An easy and familiar project for first-year CS students to tinker with and make their first open-source contributions using C!

## Requirements
- GCC 
- make

Feel free to try out [dev_setup](https://github.com/TaH00R/dev_setup) for a one-stop way to install the tools you need.

## Setup
- Clone/download the repo and go into that folder
- Open the terminal and run:
```
make
```
- This will use the config in `main.c`
- Your exe will be in the `/bin` folder to use

## Customization
Edit `main.c` to your liking using the available functions. All functions return a string, so they work directly inside `printf`.

### Available functions
- `get_user()` — Your username (e.g. `r1ftzy`)
- `get_hostname()` — Your system name (e.g. `LAPTOP-XXXXXXX`)
- `get_device()` — Your device model (e.g. `ROG Zephyrus G16 GU605MV_GU605MV`)
- `get_device_clean()` — Cleaner device name (e.g. `ROG Zephyrus G16`)
- `get_architecture()` — CPU architecture (e.g. `x86-64`, `ARM64`)
- `get_logical_cores()` — Number of logical cores/threads (e.g. `22`)
- `get_cpu()` — Full CPU name (e.g. `Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H`)
- `get_os()` — Full OS version (e.g. `Windows 11 Home Single Language`)
- `get_os_clean()` — Shorter OS name (e.g. `Windows 11`)
- `get_shell()` — Current shell (e.g. `PowerShell`)
- `get_terminal()` — Current terminal (e.g. `Windows Terminal`)
